# Etsy Management System — AI-Powered Etsy Shop Automation for Claude (MCP)

**An open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server + agent skill library that lets Claude manage a real Etsy shop end-to-end** — listings, inventory, images, shipping, orders, reviews, pricing, SEO, and finances — through natural conversation. Built for sellers who want an AI assistant that can actually *act* on their Etsy store, not just talk about it.

If you're searching for **"Etsy API MCP server"**, **"Claude Etsy integration"**, **"AI Etsy shop manager"**, **"Etsy listing automation with AI"**, or **"Etsy SEO agent for Claude Code"** — this is that project.

## What is this?

This repository turns Claude (via [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) or any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)-compatible client) into a full Etsy shop operator:

- A **custom-built Node.js/TypeScript MCP server** (`etsy-mcp-server/`) that wraps the entire Etsy Open API v3 — ~90 tools covering listings, variations, images, videos, digital files, shipping, returns, orders, payments, reviews, and shop settings.
- **22 ready-made "agency skills"** (`.claude/skills/`) — repeatable playbooks that turn raw API calls into real seller workflows: SEO audits, competitor research, listing copywriting, pricing checks, fee-anomaly detection, financial reports, review analysis, order fulfillment, and more.
- **Multi-account support** — manage more than one connected Etsy shop from the same install, switching between them by name.
- A hard **safety rule baked into every write path**: nothing is ever created, updated, or deleted on your live shop without first showing you an old → new diff and waiting for explicit confirmation.

Point Claude at your Etsy shop and ask things like *"audit my whole shop"*, *"why did sales drop this month"*, *"write SEO copy for a new listing"*, *"which orders need to ship today"*, or *"optimize this listing to compete with the top sellers in my niche"* — and it does the research, shows you the plan, and (with your go-ahead) executes it live.

## Key Features

- 🏪 **Full shop management** — create/update/delete listings, manage variations & inventory, upload images/videos/digital files, configure shipping and return policies, all through conversational requests
- 🔎 **Market intelligence** — competitor research, niche saturation scanning, keyword/tag mining from top-ranked listings, trending-product discovery
- ✍️ **SEO-driven copywriting** — research-first title/tags/description generation that mirrors what's actually ranking, gated behind a mandatory Copy QA checklist (no AI-tell phrasing, no em dashes, no placeholder text)
- 💰 **Financial visibility** — P&L reports, fee-anomaly ("did Etsy overcharge me") detection, pricing audits against live market rates — all from the read-only Payments/Ledger API
- ⭐ **Review intelligence** — theme-mining across all reviews, per-listing complaint clustering, and on-brand reply drafting
- 📦 **Operations** — daily shop briefings, ship-by deadline tracking, tracking submission — one confirmed action at a time
- 🔐 **Multi-account, OAuth-managed** — connect any number of Etsy shops; access tokens auto-refresh; each account can use its own Etsy Developer App credentials or share a default one
- 🛡️ **Confirm-before-write by design** — every mutating call is gated behind an explicit user confirmation showing exactly what will change
- 🧠 **Self-documenting** — when a live API call surfaces an undocumented Etsy requirement or a server bug, the project's own rules require it to be fixed *and* written down, so the same failure never happens twice

```

Two MCP servers are wired in:

| Server | What it is |
|---|---|
| `etsy` | This project's own server — every read/write tool against your shop |
| `etsy-docs` | Etsy's official hosted, read-only API documentation server — used to look up exact field requirements straight from the live spec instead of guesswork |

---

## Tool Catalog

The `etsy` MCP server exposes tools across every major Etsy Open API v3 resource:

| Category | Tools | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Public / market research** (no OAuth) | 7 | `search_listings`, `get_shop_by_name`, `get_trending_listings`, `get_shop_reviews` |
| **Listings** (your shop) | 10 | `create_draft_listing`, `update_listing`, `delete_listing`, `get_listings_by_shop` |
| **Variations & inventory** | 4 | `update_listing_inventory`, `get_listing_inventory`, `update_variation_images` |
| **Images & video** | 6 | `upload_listing_image`, `upload_listing_video`, `delete_listing_image` |
| **Digital download files** | 4 | `upload_listing_file`, `get_all_listing_files`, `delete_listing_file` |
| **Return policies** | 5 | `create_shop_return_policy`, `update_shop_return_policy`, `consolidate_shop_return_policies` |
| **Shop settings** | 8 | `update_shop`, `create_shop_section`, `get_shop_production_partners` |
| **Shipping** | 13 | `create_shop_shipping_profile`, `create_shipping_profile_destination`, `create_processing_profile` |
| **Orders / receipts** | 8 | `get_shop_receipts`, `update_shop_receipt`, `create_receipt_shipment` (emails the buyer tracking) |
| **Payments (read-only)** | 5 | `get_payment_ledger_entries`, `get_payments`, `get_payment_by_receipt` |
| **Reviews** | 1 | `get_reviews_by_listing` |
| **User / account** | 4 | `get_me`, `list_accounts`, `set_default_account` |

**Every array-typed field is auto-coerced** (a permanent server-side fix for a real bug where JSON arrays arriving as strings caused opaque 400s), and every write tool goes through a generic dispatcher that already supports every field Etsy's API accepts — no code changes needed to pass new parameters.

For the exact parameter list, field-level requirements, and every live-API gotcha discovered so far (readiness states, custom-property naming, offering readiness requirements, etc.), see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#which-tool-to-call--quick-map) and [etsy-mcp-server/README.md](etsy-mcp-server/README.md).

## Safety Model

This is not a "read-only demo" — it's wired to write to a live, real Etsy shop. So it ships with a hard rule:

> **Any tool call that creates, updates, or deletes data on Etsy must be confirmed by the user before it executes.** The agent shows exactly what will change — which item, which fields, old value → new value — and waits for an explicit yes before calling the tool.

Read-only tools (`get_*`, `find_*`, `search_*`, `list_*`) run freely. Everything else stops for you first.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Get an Etsy Developer App** at [etsy.com/developers/register](https://www.etsy.com/developers/register) for your own API key/secret.
2. **Build the server:**
   ```bash
   cd etsy-mcp-server
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Set credentials** — copy `.env.example` → `.env`, fill in `ETSY_API_KEY` / `ETSY_SHARED_SECRET`.
4. **Connect your shop:**
   ```bash
   node oauth-setup.js <your-shop-name>
   ```
5. **Wire it into your AI tool** — copy `.mcp.json.example` → `.mcp.json` for Claude Code, or see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#deploying-to-google-antigravity) for Google Antigravity setup.

Full setup, multi-account instructions, and every tool's exact parameters are documented in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [etsy-mcp-server/README.md](etsy-mcp-server/README.md).

## Updating to the Latest Version

If you already have this project cloned and running, pull the latest changes any time:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This only touches code, skills, and docs — it's always safe to run. Everything shop-specific (`data/`, `accounts.json`, `.env`, `Add Product/`, `Shoots/`, `.mcp.json`) is gitignored, so a pull never overwrites your credentials, listing records, or staging content.

After pulling, depending on what changed:

- **`etsy-mcp-server/src/index.ts` changed** (a new/fixed tool) — rebuild the server, then restart your Claude Code / Antigravity session so it picks up the new build:
  ```bash
  cd etsy-mcp-server
  npm run build
  ```
- **`.claude/skills/` or `.agent/skills/` changed** (a skill playbook updated) — no rebuild needed, but restart your session so the updated skill text is picked up.
- **`.mcp.json.example` changed** (a new server or env var was added) — your own `.mcp.json` is gitignored and won't update automatically; diff it against the new `.mcp.json.example` and add whatever's new by hand.
- **If `git pull` reports a conflict** on a file you've customized locally (e.g. you edited a skill yourself), that's expected — resolve it like any normal git conflict, or `git stash` your local edit first if you just want the latest version.

If you've never cloned this project before, see "Getting Started" above instead — this section is for keeping an existing install current, not first-time setup.

## Rate Limits

Etsy enforces **5 requests/second and 5,000 requests/day per API key**. Tools that support batch lookups (`get_listings_by_ids`, etc.) are used in favor of per-item loops wherever a skill iterates over many listings or orders.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js / TypeScript** MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
- **Etsy Open API v3** (OAuth 2.0 + PKCE)
- **Claude Code** agent skills (Markdown-based, trigger-phrase driven)
- Also deployable to **Google Antigravity** — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#deploying-to-google-antigravity)
