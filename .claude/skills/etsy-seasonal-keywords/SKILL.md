description: >-
  Proactively rotates seasonal/holiday keywords into the titles and tags of
  relevant listings ahead of a shopping window, then rotates them back out
  after the window closes. Trigger this whenever the user says things like "get
  my shop ready for [holiday]", "rotate in seasonal keywords", "prep my
  listings for Christmas / Valentine's / Mother's Day / Halloween", "add
  holiday tags", or asks for a standing seasonal SEO plan or calendar. Also
  trigger when a major gift holiday is approaching and the user asks generally
  how to capture that traffic. Prefer running this skill over ad-hoc tag edits,
  because it reasons about timing (pre-holiday runway) and, critically, builds
  in an explicit revert plan so seasonal terms don't sit stale year-round. Every
  actual update_listing call — both the seasonal insertion and the later
  revert — requires its own per-listing confirmation.

# Etsy Seasonal Keywords

Seasonal buyers search with seasonal language: "valentines day gift", "christmas
gift for mom", "halloween svg". Listings that carry those phrases *during the
buying window* surface for that traffic; the same phrases left in place
year-round are dead weight that crowds out evergreen keywords. This skill times
the rotation in (ahead of the window) and — just as importantly — plans the
rotation back out (after it closes).

## Timing principle

Gift holidays have a **buying runway**: shoppers (and Etsy's ranking, which
rewards listings that have accrued relevance and sales for a query) reward being
in early. Aim to insert seasonal keywords roughly **6-8 weeks before** the
holiday, and reason about the exact lead from the holiday's gift-buying pattern
(Christmas pulls earlier — 8+ weeks; a smaller occasion may only need 4). State
your reasoning for the chosen start date rather than applying a flat rule.

Set an explicit **revert date** for shortly after the holiday (typically within a
week after), so the seasonal terms don't linger and dilute evergreen SEO for the
other ~11 months.

## Mandatory gates (single checklist — do not restate rules here)

Run every gate in `../_shared/listing-gates.md` that applies to this flow, in order A → B → C → D → E: shop-DNA read,
`sources` hard-block, trademark screen, photo verification, jewelry style-match, **rank-first title**
(`../_shared/rank-first-title-guide.md`), Copy QA Gate, **DELIVERY TIME FRAME** block, table-confirmed write,
listings-record / tags-bank / registry bookkeeping, final verification. The steps below add flow-specific detail only;
they never override a gate. If this file ever disagrees with that checklist or CLAUDE.md, the checklist wins — report the
contradiction to the user instead of choosing silently.

## Workflow

### 1. Check the shop's holiday configuration

Call `get_holiday_preferences` to see the shop's configured holiday
deadlines/processing behavior. This grounds the timing conversation in the
shop's real fulfillment reality — no point pushing "order by X for Christmas
delivery" language that conflicts with the shop's actual processing/holiday
settings. Note any relevant deadlines in the report.

### 2. Identify genuinely relevant listings

Pull the user's listings via `get_listings_by_shop` /
`find_all_active_listings_by_shop`, then full detail with `get_listings_by_ids`
(batch — respect the 5 req/s, 5,000/day limit) or `get_listing_details`.

For each, **reason about whether it actually fits the seasonal window** from its
title, tags, and category. Not everything qualifies. A "gift for her" jewelry
piece fits Valentine's; a set of tax-invoice templates does not. A generic
floral SVG might fit Mother's Day; a Halloween skull SVG does not fit Valentine's.
Don't blanket-apply seasonal terms to the whole shop — that's exactly the noise
this skill exists to avoid. When a listing is borderline, include it but say why
it's marginal.

### 3. Propose specific insertions

For each qualifying listing, propose concrete seasonal phrasing to add — e.g.
insert "valentines day gift" or "gift for her" into an available tag slot, and
optionally weave a seasonal phrase into the title. Respect Etsy limits: **max 13
tags, each ≤ 20 characters, all lowercase** (see `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`
— lowercase is the shop's own style rule, not an API rejection, but every
inserted tag must still follow it). If all 13 tag slots are full, name which
weakest tag the seasonal term temporarily displaces — and record that displaced
tag so the revert can restore it exactly.

### 4. Build the revert plan

For every insertion, record the pre-change state so the revert is a clean
restore: the original tag (or empty slot) and original title. The revert plan is
a first-class deliverable, not an afterthought.

### 5. Run the Copy QA Gate on every proposed title insertion

Tag insertions are short keywords and rarely trigger the reading-level/em-dash
checks, but any listing where a seasonal phrase gets woven into the **title**
must pass the full checklist in `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md` (no em
dashes, grade 5-7 phrasing, no AI-tell filler, field limits re-verified) before
it's shown in section 3 below. This is a hard gate, same as the copywriter and
optimizer skills — do not present or apply a title insertion that hasn't
passed it.

## Report structure

Produce the report in exactly these sections:

### 1. Upcoming Holiday Window & Suggested Timing

- The holiday and its date.
- Relevant deadlines from `get_holiday_preferences`.
- Suggested insertion start date (with your runway reasoning) and revert date.

### 2. Candidate Listings

| Listing (title / id) | Why it qualifies | Marginal? |
|----------------------|------------------|-----------|

Include the reasoning per listing so the user can veto anything that doesn't fit.

### 3. Proposed Tag/Title Insertions

| Listing | Field | Current | Proposed (seasonal) | Displaces (to restore later) |
|---------|-------|---------|---------------------|------------------------------|

Every proposed set stays ≤ 13 tags, each ≤ 20 chars.

### 4. Revert Plan

| Listing | Field | Seasonal value (remove) | Restore to | Revert on/after |
|---------|-------|-------------------------|------------|-----------------|

## Applying changes — confirm every single one, twice over

The only write tool is **`update_listing`**, against a live, real-money shop.
**Both phases are gated:**

- **Insertion:** apply one listing at a time. For each, show the exact
  before → after and wait for an explicit "yes / haan / confirm" for *that
  listing* before the single `update_listing` call. Never batch-apply.
- **Revert:** same discipline. When the window closes and it's time to revert,
  re-confirm each listing's before → after individually at execution time.
- **After each successful `update_listing` call (insertion or revert),
  sync that listing's `tags` into its record** per
  `../_shared/listings-record-guide.md`
  (`data/listings/<account>/<listing_id>.json`) — mandatory, no separate
  confirmation, so the record reflects what's actually live right now, not
  what was live before the seasonal rotation.

## No built-in scheduling — be explicit about that

The etsy MCP tools have **no cron/scheduler**. This skill cannot make a change
"fire on its own" on the start or revert date. It plans the dates and reminds;
the actual `update_listing` calls only happen when the user is present and
re-confirms. Do not imply an edit will auto-apply later.

If the user wants true hands-off automation (auto-insert on the start date,
auto-revert after), point them at **Claude Code's own `/schedule` capability** as
the mechanism — a scheduled task can re-invoke this skill at the right time — and
note that even then, the safety rule means the scheduled run should surface the
before/after for confirmation rather than silently mutating the live shop.

## Fallback

If unsure of exact `update_listing` or `get_holiday_preferences` field names,
look them up live via the **etsy-docs** MCP: `get_endpoint("updateListing")` /
`get_endpoint("getHolidayPreferences")` or `search_etsy_api`. Don't guess field
shapes against a live shop.
