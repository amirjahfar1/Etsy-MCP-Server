description: >-
  Writes launch-ready title, 13 tags, and description for a BRAND-NEW Etsy
  product that doesn't have a listing yet — copy-paste-ready text, produced
  through a mandatory research-first flow (read what's actually ranking for
  the target keyword, and the shop's own best-sellers if this extends an
  existing line) before any copy is generated. Trigger this whenever the user
  says things like "I'm about to list a new product, write the title/tags/description",
  "help me create a new Etsy listing", "give me a meta title and description for
  my new [product]", "write tags for this new item", "I'm launching a new
  product, what should the listing copy be", or describes a new product and
  wants the SEO copy for it. Use this — not etsy-optimize-listing — when the
  product does NOT already have a listing on Etsy; use etsy-optimize-listing
  instead when a listing already exists and needs rewriting; and when the
  creation flow also needs variants (sizes/colors), image uploads, or a
  digital deliverable file attached, use etsy-create-listing — the fuller
  end-to-end creation skill that reuses this skill's research and copy
  phases — while this skill alone remains right for just the copy text or a
  simple no-variant draft. Never skip
  straight to generating copy on a bare one-line request — this skill's whole
  value is doing the keyword/competitor research first. Every draft is
  checked against the same field/style rules etsy-listing-qa-check enforces
  before it's shown, and any created draft should get an independent
  etsy-listing-qa-check pass afterward; for deeper keyword coverage than this
  skill's own quick research pass, etsy-keyword-research is the heavier
  dedicated pre-step to run first.

# Etsy New Listing Copywriter — Research First, Then Write

This skill produces launch-ready copy — title, 13 tags, and description — for a
product that **does not exist on Etsy yet**. That's what separates it from
`etsy-audit-listing` and `etsy-optimize-listing`, which work on live listings:
here there is no existing listing to critique, so the deliverable is
copy-paste-ready text the seller drops into the listing form (or, only on
explicit request and after confirmation, a draft created via
`create_draft_listing`).

The non-negotiable shape of this skill is **research → generate, in that
order**. A seller's instinct is to ask "give me a title for my new mug" and get
one back in five seconds. Resist that instinct, even when the user pushes for
speed. Copy written without research is written against *general SEO theory*,
and general theory produces the same title every AI tool on the internet
produces — which means it competes head-on with thousands of identically
generic listings and ranks behind all of the established ones. Copy written
*after* research is grounded in two things theory can't give you: the exact
keyword phrases Etsy's search is rewarding **in this niche, right now** (read
off the listings actually ranking), and — when the product extends an existing
line — the phrasing and voice that **this shop's own buyers already respond
to**. Ten minutes of research is the difference between copy that sounds
plausible and copy that has a reason to exist.

Every tool below accepts an optional `account` argument; pass it if the user
names a specific shop, otherwise the default account is used.

**Field rules live in `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`.** Read it if any
limit below feels uncertain — it is the single source of truth shared across
all etsy-* skills, so a correction there propagates everywhere. The hard
constraints are also restated inline in Phase 2 at the exact point each field
is drafted, because a constraint mentioned once at the top and forgotten by
the time the tags are written is how invalid drafts happen. If a field name or
limit is still unclear, confirm it via the read-only `etsy-docs` MCP
(`get_endpoint`, `search_etsy_api`) — never guess in a payload.

## Safety — this skill's default output is text, not a write

This project manages a real, live-money shop. Per the project-wide rule, any
`create_*` tool call requires explicit user confirmation first.

- The **default deliverable is the copy-paste report** at the end of this
  skill. Producing it requires only read-only tools (`search_*`, `get_*`) —
  no confirmation needed for any research step.
- Do **not** call `create_draft_listing` unprompted. Offer it once, at the end
  of the report, as an option.
- **Per the Listing Completeness Gate (`../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`): a
  draft is never created with zero images, full stop — this skill's create
  offer is not an exception.** Before offering to create the draft, collect
  at least one real local image path (or confirm one is already at hand). If
  the user has no image ready yet, deliver the copy-paste blocks only and
  hold the create offer until they do — never create a "photo-less draft to
  hold the spot."
- If the user *does* want the draft created: show the **exact payload**
  (title, tags, description, price, quantity, who_made, when_made,
  taxonomy_id, shipping profile — every field that will be sent), then stop
  and wait for an explicit "yes / haan / confirm". An enthusiastic "love it!"
  about the copy is approval of the *copy*, not authorization to *write* —
  ask the write question separately and unambiguously.
- If the user tweaks any field after seeing the payload, re-show the full
  updated payload and confirm again.
- If the user's tweak edits the title/tags/description text itself, re-run
  the Copy QA Gate (see Pre-flight validation below) against the edited text
  before showing the updated payload — a user tweak can just as easily
  introduce an em dash or push reading level up as an AI-drafted line can.
- After a confirmed create succeeds, fetch the new listing back
  (`get_listing`) and echo the created listing_id and its actual field values,
  so the user sees what landed — not just that the call returned success.
  **Then write the listings-record file**
  (`data/listings/<account>/<listing_id>.json`) per
  `../_shared/listings-record-guide.md` — mandatory for every listing this
  skill creates, not just the ones built via `etsy-create-listing`.
  Then offer to run **etsy-listing-qa-check** against the new draft as an
  independent confirmation that the live listing matches the rules it was
  drafted against.
- Note the listing is created as a **draft** (inactive), with the one (or
  more) collected image(s) already uploaded as part of the same confirmed
  flow — not promised for later. Offer to add further photos/video via
  `upload_listing_image`/`upload_listing_video` if the owner has more files
  ready locally (each upload still needs its own confirmation), otherwise
  they can add them in Etsy's UI. Say plainly that the draft isn't
  buyer-visible until it's published — don't let the user assume a finished,
  live listing exists yet.

## Mandatory gates (single checklist — do not restate rules here)

Run every gate in `../_shared/listing-gates.md` that applies to this flow, in order A → B → C → D → E: shop-DNA read,
`sources` hard-block, trademark screen, photo verification, jewelry style-match, **rank-first title**
(`../_shared/rank-first-title-guide.md`), Copy QA Gate, **DELIVERY TIME FRAME** block, table-confirmed write,
listings-record / tags-bank / registry bookkeeping, final verification. The steps below add flow-specific detail only;
they never override a gate. If this file ever disagrees with that checklist or CLAUDE.md, the checklist wins — report the
contradiction to the user instead of choosing silently.

## Phase 1 — RESEARCH

### Step 0 — Get the product brief (ask, don't assume)

If the user hasn't already provided these, ask before touching any tool.
Ask them together in one message, not as an interrogation drip:

1. **What is the product?** One or two sentences — enough to know what a buyer
   would type to find it.
2. **Format and materials** — physical or digital? What's it made of / what
   files does the buyer get? (This feeds tags, the `materials` field, and the
   description's practical section.)
3. **Intended price range** — even a rough band. Research will show the
   market band; knowing where the seller wants to sit shapes positioning
   language ("premium hand-finished" vs "budget-friendly bundle").
4. **Does this extend an existing product line in the shop?** If yes, the
   shop's own winners become a second research source. If it's a brand-new
   direction, skip the internal benchmark and say so — don't force it.
5. **Who is it for / what occasion**, if the user knows. If they don't,
   research will propose answers — that's fine, note it as a hypothesis.

If the user gives a thin brief and wants to skip questions, proceed with what
exists but label every assumption in the final report.

### Step 0b — Collect the operational fields early, not at confirmation time

`create_draft_listing` needs more than copy — `quantity`, `who_made`,
`when_made`, `taxonomy_id` (category), and a `shipping_profile_id` /
`return_policy_id` are all required or near-required fields. Gathering these
only when the full payload is shown at the end stalls the confirmation step
and forces a second round-trip. Instead, alongside the brief in Step 0:

- Call `get_shop_shipping_profiles` and `get_shop_return_policies` and offer
  the user a short pick-list of the shop's existing profiles (most shops
  reuse one or two) rather than asking them to know a raw ID.
- Ask `who_made` (i_did / someone_else / collective), `when_made`, and
  `quantity` as plain questions.
- Resolve a best-inferred `taxonomy_id` from the product brief — look it up
  via the `etsy-docs` MCP (`search_etsy_api`/`get_endpoint`), never guess a
  raw number with no lookup behind it — then **present the category name
  and id to the user and get explicit confirmation** (use it, or name a
  different one) before it enters the create payload. Same standing rule as
  `etsy-create-listing` Step 3: a valid-but-wrong category won't error at
  `create_draft_listing`, it'll just misfile the listing silently, so the
  live API accepting it is not a substitute for asking.

Skip this step entirely if the user only wants copy-paste text with no
`create_draft_listing` call in play.

### Step 1 — Form the keyword hypothesis, then confirm how to benchmark it

From the brief, write down 2-4 candidate search phrases a buyer would
actually type — not marketing language, buyer language ("boho wall decor",
not "artisanal bohemian-inspired living accent"). These are hypotheses;
Step 2 tests them.

First check the tags database (`../_shared/tags-database-guide.md`) for a
category matching the product brief. Then, before researching, ask the user
directly — the same question `etsy-optimize-listing` asks, for consistency,
with a fourth option added here for preferred-tags-in-hand cases: "Do you
already have preferred keywords/tags you want used, do you want to give me
2-3 top-ranking listings so I can analyze their tags into common vs unique
and we decide together, should I search for them myself using these
candidate keywords: `<list>`, or should I use the saved tags already in the
database for `<category>`?"

- **User gives preferred keywords/tags directly:** treat them as the seed
  tag set — still run Step 2's title/description research (title anatomy,
  price band, description openers, gaps) so the copy isn't written blind;
  only the tag-sourcing half of Step 2 is skipped. State plainly in the
  report that these tags were user-supplied, not research-derived, then
  fold them into Step 2b's decision gate alongside anything else surfaced.
- **User provides listings to analyze:** pull `get_listing_details` on
  exactly those as the external benchmark set — skip the keyword search in
  Step 2, but still run Step 2's full tag-frequency analysis (common vs
  unique) against this user-given set. Present the resulting table and go
  to Step 2b before anything gets drafted.
- **Skill searches:** confirm or let the user refine the 2-4 candidate
  keywords, then proceed to Step 2 with the confirmed set. If the niche is
  broad or the user wants wider keyword coverage than this skill's own quick
  pass gives, offer **etsy-keyword-research** as a heavier, dedicated
  pre-step — it mines a wider competitor set into a full frequency-ranked
  keyword cluster — before coming back here to draft.
- **Use saved tags:** treat the database's saved tags for that category as
  this run's tag findings — still run Step 2's title/description research
  (the database only substitutes for the tag frequency table), and
  re-validate every saved tag against the current field/style rules before
  drafting.

### Step 2 — External benchmark: read what's actually ranking

Skip this entire step if the user chose to supply their own reference
listings in Step 1 — use those `get_listing_details` pulls as the benchmark
instead of searching.

For the confirmed candidate phrase(s) from Step 1, call `search_listings` and
take the **top 10-15 results** — not 2-3; two listings sharing a pattern is
coincidence, half the sample sharing it is a signal. Pull full details with
`get_listing_details` (batch thinking: respect the 5 req/s, 5,000/day
rate limit — don't fan out across five keyword variants at full depth).

**Relevance screen, before tallying anything.** Drop any result that isn't
genuinely the same product type as the brief — a search for "dog tag" can
return collars, art prints, or unrelated novelty items alongside real dog
tags. State how many were dropped and why. If fewer than 8 genuinely
relevant results remain after dropping, broaden the phrase or run a second
candidate before proceeding — a tally polluted by off-category listings
shifts the "at least half" bar meaningfully at this sample size.

**Weight the read toward listings with real proof of demand.**
`get_listing_details` also returns each listing's `num_favorers` (a real
cumulative count) and, for active listings, a daily-tabulated `views` count
(can read 0 for reasons unrelated to actual traffic — treat as directional,
not exact). When extracting title/tag patterns below, note which listings
carry meaningfully higher `num_favorers` than the rest of the sample — a
"unique" tag or title angle coming from a high-favorer listing is a more
credible signal than the same angle from a listing with zero favorers. This
doesn't replace the sample-wide frequency tally, it just tells you which
data points in that tally to trust more.

Extract, concretely:

- **Title anatomy** — what do the first ~40 characters of ranking titles
  contain? What separator convention dominates (pipes, commas, dashes)?
  What modifier types appear (material, size, occasion, recipient)?
- **Tag frequency table** — tally every tag across the sample. Tags appearing
  in **at least half the sample** (e.g. 8+ of 15) are the niche's
  table-stakes vocabulary — the same "at least half" bar used everywhere
  else in this skill set for pattern-detection and for the tags database's
  `common` classification; tags appearing on only 1-2 high-ranking listings
  may be underexploited angles (the database's `unique` classification).
  Both matter: the first group gets the new listing into the right searches,
  the second is where a new listing can actually win. Right after presenting
  this table (skip if this run used saved database tags instead),
  **automatically save these tags to the tags database — no need to ask** —
  see `../_shared/tags-database-guide.md` for the save workflow.
- **Price and shipping — always report both, and always end with a number
  recommendation, standing rule.** For every listing in the benchmark set
  (whether the user supplied it or this skill searched for it), pull its
  `price` and its shipping cost (primary domestic cost from
  `shipping_profile`/`get_shop_shipping_profile` when visible; note "free
  shipping"/"not visible" per listing when it isn't). Compute and state
  plainly:
  - **Average price** across the sample.
  - **Average shipping cost** across the sample (separately from price, not
    folded silently into one landed number — the seller needs to see both
    to make a shipping-profile decision, not just a sell-price decision).
  - **Landed price** (price + shipping) per the shared standards file, for
    positioning context.
  - **A concrete price suggestion for this new listing** — a specific number
    or tight range, reasoned from the average and from where this product's
    differentiators (or lack of them) justify sitting above, at, or below
    that average. Never end price research with just a range and no
    recommendation — the seller should not have to do that math themselves.
  Note that visible prices may be temporary sale prices the API can't
  distinguish — caveat, don't assert.
- **Description openers** — read the first ~160 characters of the top 3-5.
  What claim do they lead with? That's the snippet game the new listing has
  to play.
- **Personalization requirements (for any customizable/personalized
  product)** — read each benchmark listing's actual buyer-facing
  instructions (the "How to order"/"Personalization" section of the
  description, not just the tags) and tally what buyers are actually asked
  to submit — name/text, font choice, color choice, multiple names, a photo
  upload, a date, initials, number of lines, character limits, etc. Fields
  appearing in at least half the sample are this niche's standard
  personalization set; note any outliers as optional add-ons. This tally is
  not just copy research — it feeds `etsy-create-listing`'s Step 4b
  (`update_listing_personalization`) and, where a field affects price/SKU
  rather than being pure buyer text (e.g. a color or size choice), its
  Step 5 variation structure. Never invent personalization fields from
  guesswork when live competitor listings show exactly what buyers expect
  to be asked for.
- **Gaps** — angles (occasion, recipient, use-case) the ranking set is *not*
  covering. A new listing can't out-age incumbents, but it can own a phrase
  they're all ignoring.
- **Seasonal check.** If a major gifting occasion or season is roughly 2-10
  weeks out and plausibly relevant to this product, note it explicitly and
  propose dedicating one of the 13 tag slots to it in Step 2b. If the
  product is genuinely evergreen (no relevant near-term occasion), state
  that plainly instead of silently skipping the question.

Optionally sanity-check demand direction with `get_trending_listings` — if
the niche is adjacent to something currently trending, that's a phrasing
opportunity worth one tag; if not, skip it, trending data is broad-brush.

### Step 2b — Decide the tag set together before writing anything

Do not let Phase 2 auto-pick the 13 tags from the frequency table alone.
Present the **common** (≥half the sample) and **unique** (1-2 listings)
lists from Step 2 as two clearly separated groups, and ask the user which
they want prioritized for the 13 slots — leaning harder into common
table-stakes terms, chasing more unique/underexploited angles, mixing in
specific tags of their own choosing, or "you decide, go with the default
allocation." If the user gave preferred keywords/tags directly back in
Step 1, fold those in here too so there's one agreed list, not two competing
ones. Wait for this answer before Phase 2 drafts the title, tags, or
description — the title's keyword segments and the description's angle
should trace back to whatever priorities got agreed here, not just to the
raw frequency table.

### Step 3 — Internal benchmark: the shop's own voice and winners
*(only if Step 0 said this extends an existing line)*

- Pull `get_receipt_transactions_by_shop` over a trailing 90-day window,
  count sales per listing_id, and treat listings with **≥5 sales** as
  winners. Fetch their details in one `get_listings_by_ids` batch call.
  Prefer winners from the **same product type** as the new product — a
  best-selling item from an unrelated line has the wrong cadence to imitate.
- From those winners, extract: title cadence, which tag *types* they lean on,
  price positioning, and description formatting habits (bullets vs prose,
  emoji or none, how sizing/files/shipping info is presented).
- Call `get_shop` and read the announcement/bio for brand voice.
- **If fewer than 3 listings qualify as winners at the 90-day window, widen
  once to a trailing 180-day window before giving up** — a seasonal or
  slower-moving shop can have genuine winners the 90-day cut misses. Label
  which window ended up being used in the report. **Only skip this
  benchmark entirely, and say so plainly, if still fewer than 3 winners at
  180 days** — the copy then leans on the external benchmark alone, and
  that's a stated confidence downgrade, not something to hide.

The point of this step: the new listing should read like *this shop wrote
it*, not like an SEO tool wrote it. Voice consistency across a shop is a
conversion asset; twenty listings that all sound like the same generic
optimizer dilute the brand.

### Step 4 — Synthesize before writing anything

One short paragraph, stated to the user in the report: "Here's what's ranking
for X, here's the vocabulary the niche uses, here's the gap this listing will
aim at, here's the voice it will be written in, here's the tag set we agreed
on in Step 2b." Every generation decision in Phase 2 must trace back to a
line in this synthesis. If a decision can't be traced to research, it's
theory — flag it as such.

---

## Phase 2 — GENERATION

Everything here is drafted against Phase 1's findings, with the field rules
enforced *at the point of writing*, not remembered from the top of the file.

### Title

**Rank-first (mandatory, 2026-10-07):** before writing any title, run the procedure in
`../_shared/rank-first-title-guide.md` — top-20 ranking listings for the buyer's search term, lead-phrase pattern
shown as a table — and build characters 1-40 from that pattern. The structure notes below only govern the
remaining characters and the hard field limits.

Constraints (hard, from the API — see `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`):
**max 140 characters**; letters, numbers, punctuation, math symbols,
whitespace, ™ © ® allowed; the characters **`%` `:` `&` `+` may each appear
at most ONCE** — a second use is an API rejection, so if the draft needs
"Mix & Match" and "Salt & Pepper", one of them gets rewritten.

Structure: `[Primary Keyword] | [Secondary Keyword + Modifier] | [Occasion
or Recipient]`

- The **first ~40 characters** carry the most search weight — they must
  contain the primary keyword phrase from Step 2, verbatim as buyers type
  it, not a prettier paraphrase of it.
- **No keyword repetition.** Do not use the same word/phrase 2-3 times
  ("Dad Shirt Father Shirt Dad Gift") — per 2026 guidance it no longer helps
  ranking and it costs clicks because it reads as spam. Each segment covers
  a *different* buyer angle: what it is → who it's for or the occasion →
  material/style/format modifier. If two segments share a word, rewrite one.
- **Target 130-139 characters** (shop instruction — maximize keyword
  coverage, don't stop early). If the first pass lands short (e.g. 90-100
  chars), don't call it done: add another genuine, distinct buyer-search
  angle — a second material/style modifier, a specific room/placement, a
  gift-recipient variant, a size/format callout — anything a real buyer
  might type that the current draft doesn't yet cover. Never fill the gap
  with padding or repeated words — every added segment must be a real
  distinct angle, checked against the no-repetition rule above the same as
  the rest of the title.
- If the user asks for a "meta title": Etsy has no separate meta-title
  field — the title IS the Google/page headline. Answer with the title.

Before presenting, **count the characters and state the count.**

### Tags — all 13, no exceptions, no near-duplicates

Constraints (hard): exactly **13 slots**, each **≤20 characters**; letters,
numbers, whitespace, `-`, `'` (cannot *start* with `-` or `'`), ™ © ® — no
other punctuation, the API rejects it. No tag may exactly duplicate another
tag or the title verbatim. **All lowercase** — this is a shop style rule
(not an API rejection), but every tag must still be written and checked as
lowercase before presenting.

Fill the 13 slots per the priorities agreed in **Step 2b**, by **buyer
intent** — not by rephrasing one keyword thirteen ways, since a near-duplicate
is technically valid and strategically worthless, wasting a slot on a search
the listing already matches. If Step 2b's answer was "you decide," fall back
to this default allocation (not a straitjacket — reallocate based on what
Step 2's frequency table showed matters in this niche):

| Slots | Intent | Sourced from |
|---|---|---|
| 2-3 | What it is (primary + one long-tail variant) | Step 2 table-stakes tags |
| 2 | Material / format | Product brief |
| 2 | Occasion (holiday, event, season) | Step 2 + calendar proximity |
| 2 | Recipient ("gift for her", "teacher gift") | Step 2 gaps |
| 2 | Use-case / placement ("nursery decor", "cricut project") | Step 2 |
| 1-2 | Style / aesthetic ("boho", "minimalist") | Shop voice + niche vocabulary |
| 1 | Underexploited angle from Step 2's gap analysis | The "win" tag |

Multi-word tags matching real long-tail searches beat single broad words —
"personalized dog mom" works harder than "dog". Before presenting, **check
every tag's length and uniqueness** and show the character count next to
each; a confirmed draft the API bounces is a wasted round-trip.

### Description

Constraints: no hard API limit (~10,000 chars practically), but the **first
~160 characters are the search-result / Google snippet** — and the working
target for conversion is **150-400 words**, scannable, not a wall of prose.

Structure:

1. **The hook (first 160 characters).** Written like an ad headline:
   outcome + product + differentiator. Never "Welcome to my shop!", never
   scene-setting ("There's nothing quite like..."), never a materials
   recitation. It should survive being read *alone* in a Google result and
   still earn the click. Draft it separately, count its characters, then
   weld it to the top of the body.
2. **What it is / what you get** — 2-4 short lines or bullets. For digital
   products: exact file formats, dimensions, what's included, "no physical
   item shipped" stated plainly (it preempts the most common 1-star review).
3. **Details** — materials, sizes, variations, personalization options.
   Bullets, not paragraphs.
4. **How to use / how it arrives** — download instructions or
   processing/shipping expectations.
5. **One closing line** in the shop's voice — care note, invitation to the
   rest of the line, whatever the shop's winners do (Step 3). Skip it if
   there's no internal benchmark rather than inventing a personality.

Formatting follows the shop's established habits from Step 3 (bullets vs
prose, emoji or none). No keyword-stuffing — the description sells to the
human who already clicked; the title and tags did the search work.

### Materials & Styles (bonus fields, cheap to include)

- `materials`: array of strings, **letters/numbers/whitespace only** — no
  punctuation, no hyphens ("100% cotton" is invalid; "cotton" is valid).
- `styles`: up to **2**, each **≤45 characters**, letters/numbers/whitespace
  only. Pull from Step 2's niche vocabulary.

### Pre-flight validation (run before presenting, every time)

- [ ] Title ≤140 chars; primary keyword inside the first ~40; `% : & +`
      each used at most once; no repeated keyword phrase
- [ ] Exactly 13 tags; every tag ≤20 chars; valid characters only; all
      lowercase; no exact duplicates of each other or the title; intents
      spread, not rephrased
- [ ] Hook ≤~160 chars and reads as an ad headline standing alone
- [ ] Description 150-400 words, scannable structure
- [ ] Materials/styles character rules met
- [ ] Every major copy choice traceable to a Phase 1 finding
- [ ] **Line-up test.** Place this draft's first ~40 title characters and its
      description hook next to the equivalent from the top 3 benchmark
      listings. Answer in one sentence each: what does this listing offer
      that those three don't, and would the hook survive standing alone in a
      Google snippet next to them? If the honest answer to the first is
      "nothing," rewrite the differentiator segment before presenting —
      don't let a title merely comply with the rules while reading
      identically to everything it's competing against.
- [ ] **Copy QA Gate** (`../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`) — full checklist
      passed: no em dashes, grade 5-7 reading level, no AI-tell phrasing, no
      misleading claims, not copied verbatim from a competitor,
      no leftover placeholders, tone matches the shop's voice. **This gate is
      mandatory — do not present the report or call `create_draft_listing`
      on copy that hasn't passed it.** If fixing
      a QA item changes length (e.g. splitting a long sentence), re-check the
      field-limit boxes above too.
- [ ] This checklist enforces the **exact same rules `etsy-listing-qa-check`
      checks against live listings** (same shared standards file). Passing
      here means a QA-check run against the created draft should also pass —
      if it doesn't, something changed between drafting and creation (e.g. a
      user tweak after this report was shown) and is worth investigating.

## Want me to create this as a draft listing?
I can create this directly as an unpublished draft via create_draft_listing
— I'll need at least one real image file path from you first (this shop
never creates a draft with zero images). If you want that, I'll first show
you the complete payload — every field exactly as it will be sent — and
wait for your explicit confirmation before calling anything. Otherwise, the
blocks above are ready to paste into Etsy's listing form. After a confirmed
create, I'll offer to run etsy-listing-qa-check against the new draft as an
independent rules check.

## Honest limits
<the blind-spots paragraph below, adapted to this run>
```

## Blind spots — state these plainly, never paper over them

- The Etsy API exposes **no search-volume, click-through, conversion data, or
  historical traffic trend**. It does return each benchmark listing's
  current cumulative `num_favorers` and a daily-tabulated `views` count
  (active listings only) — Phase 1's Step 2 now uses these as a
  demand-weighting signal on the sample, but they're a snapshot, not a
  trend line, and still say nothing about *this* new listing's own future
  performance. This copy is a **well-grounded hypothesis, not a ranking
  guarantee** — new listings also compete on factors no copy can control
  (listing age, review history, conversion track record, photo quality).
- Photos are likely the single biggest conversion lever. This system **can**
  upload them (`upload_listing_image`/`upload_listing_video`, if the owner
  has files ready locally) but still **can't evaluate** them — judging
  quality, lighting, or composition is entirely on the seller, and worth
  saying out loud rather than letting great copy imply a finished listing.
- Competitor prices observed in research may be temporary sale prices the
  API can't distinguish from list price.
- Right after a draft is created, run **etsy-listing-qa-check** against it as
  an independent confirmation — it re-checks the live listing against the
  exact same field/style rules this copy was drafted against, catching
  anything a last-minute user tweak might have broken.
- The honest instruction to leave the user with: **treat the first 30 days
  as the experiment.** Watch actual sales (favorites/views can only be
  checked manually in Etsy's own seller dashboard — this system has no API
  access to that data); if the listing isn't moving, come back and run
  `etsy-optimize-listing` against it — by then it
  will be a live listing with its own data, which is exactly what that
  sibling skill is for.
