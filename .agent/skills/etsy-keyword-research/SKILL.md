  Mines the keywords and tags that are actually working for the top-ranking
  Etsy listings in a target niche, builds a frequency-ranked keyword cluster,
  then diffs it against the user's own listings to produce a concrete
  per-listing tag-swap plan. Trigger this whenever the user says things like
  "do keyword research for my shop", "what tags should I be using", "find
  better keywords for [niche/product]", "help my listings rank", "optimize my
  Etsy SEO", or "why can't people find my listings" — and also when they ask
  vaguer questions about visibility, discoverability, or traffic on a specific
  niche or product. Prefer running this skill over answering keyword questions
  from general knowledge, because it grounds recommendations in live top-ranked
  results rather than guesswork. Ends by offering to apply swaps one listing at
  a time via update_listing, each with an explicit before/after confirmation.

# Etsy Keyword Research

Etsy ranking is driven heavily by how well a listing's **title and 13 tags**
match what buyers actually type. This skill reverse-engineers what is already
winning in a niche — the words and phrases that repeat across top-ranked
listings — and turns that into a specific, listing-by-listing edit plan for the
user's own shop. The goal is not to guess "good keywords" from general SEO
intuition; it's to observe what the current top performers are doing and close
the gap.

## Tags database — save what this run finds

See `../_shared/tags-database-guide.md` for the full schema and workflow.
Right after presenting the Keyword Cluster (report section 1 below),
**automatically save these tags to the tags database — no need to ask.**
File them under a category you pick based on the niche researched (reusing
an existing category when the niche matches one already saved), incrementing
counts for any tag already in the database rather than overwriting it.

## The honest caveat you must state up front

**Etsy exposes no public search-volume or analytics API.** There is no way to
pull "how many people searched for X." What this skill measures is the
**frequency of a keyword/phrase across the top-ranking listings** for a query —
i.e. "what's clearly working for listings that already rank." That is a strong,
practical proxy, but it is *not* verified search volume. Always say this plainly
in the report so the user never mistakes a frequency count for a real
search-volume number. Frame recommendations as "these phrases repeat across
top performers, so they're worth testing," not "these get N searches/month."

## Use the statistics script (2026-10-21)

Tallying keywords/tags by eye is error-prone. Save each term's top-40 pull with `node scripts/term-file.mjs` and run
`node scripts/keyword-stats.mjs data/research/<category-slug>/<date> --exclude "<noise regex>"` (procedure and flags:
`../_shared/rank-first-title-guide.md`). Report numbers from its output only: tag tiers (core/standard/niche), slots, exact-head-tag %, like-for-like prices.

## Workflow

### 1. Nail down the target query set

Get the niche/product from the user. Expand it into a small set of the primary
keyword plus 2-4 close variants and buyer-phrasing alternates (e.g. for
"floral svg": also "flower svg", "floral clipart", "botanical svg bundle").
Reasoning about variants matters — Etsy buyers phrase the same intent many ways,
and a single query would give a narrow, biased sample.

### 2. Pull the top-ranking listings

For each query, call `search_listings` sorted by relevance and take the top
results (roughly the first 20-30 across the query set — enough for a stable
frequency signal without burning rate limit). These are your "what's working"
population.

Then pull full detail on each. Prefer **`get_listings_by_ids`** (batch) over
looping `get_listing_details` one call at a time — the rate limit is 5 req/s and
5,000/day, and batching keeps you well clear of it. Use `get_listing_details`
for one-off pulls or when you only have a handful. Extract each listing's
**title** and its **full tag set** (all 13 where present).

### 3. Build the frequency-ranked keyword cluster

Tokenize titles and tags into words and multi-word phrases (bigrams/trigrams
matter — "cut file", "sublimation design", "digital download" are single
concepts). Count how often each phrase appears across the top-performer set and
rank by frequency. Group near-synonyms so the cluster reads as themes, not raw
tokens. This ranked cluster is the core asset: it shows which phrases the market
leaders lean on most.

### 4. Pull the user's own listings in the niche

Use `get_listings_by_shop` (or `find_all_active_listings_by_shop`) to fetch the
user's listings, then `get_listings_by_ids` / `get_listing_details` for full
titles and tags on the ones relevant to this niche. If it's ambiguous which of
their listings belong to the niche, ask rather than guessing.

### 5. Diff and design the swaps

For each of the user's listings, compare its current tags/title against the
cluster to find:
- **Missing high-value keywords** — top-cluster phrases the listing doesn't use.
- **Wasted/redundant tags** — tags that don't appear in the cluster at all, near-
  duplicates of each other, or single words that a multi-word tag already covers
  (Etsy rewards multi-word tags; a lone "svg" tag is low value).

Respect the field and shop-style rules in `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`
when proposing new tags: **max 13 tags, each ≤ 20 characters, all
lowercase**, no exact duplicates of each other or the title. Flag any
suggested tag that would exceed 20 chars, use an uppercase character, or
duplicate another tag so it can be fixed before presenting. Prioritize
swapping the weakest existing tags for the highest-frequency
missing phrases — don't propose blowing away a listing's whole tag set unless
it's genuinely all off-target.

## Report structure

Produce the report in exactly these three sections:

### 1. Keyword Cluster (ranked by frequency)

A ranked table of the top phrases across winning listings, with their frequency
count and the theme they belong to. Open this section with the caveat, e.g.:

> Note: these counts reflect how often each phrase appears across the current
> top-ranked listings for your query — a "what's working right now" proxy, not
> verified Etsy search volume (Etsy has no public search-volume API).

| Rank | Phrase | Appears in (of N) | Theme |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... |

Immediately after this table, save to the tags database automatically as described above — no need to ask.

### 2. Per-Listing Tag-Swap Plan

One row per relevant listing, showing the concrete old → new change:

| Listing (title / id) | Current tags | Suggested tags | Key adds | Tags dropped & why |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|----------|--------------------|

Keep every suggested set ≤ 13 tags, each ≤ 20 chars. Note any title tweaks
separately if a high-value phrase belongs in the title too.

### 3. Summary

- How many of the user's listings were reviewed and how many need updates.
- The 3-5 highest-impact phrases they're currently missing shop-wide.
- A one-line "biggest quick win."

## Applying changes — confirm every single one

The only write tool here is **`update_listing`**, and it edits a live,
real-money shop. **Never bulk-apply.** After presenting the plan, offer to apply
the swaps **one listing at a time**. For each listing, before calling
`update_listing`, show the exact before → after (old tag set → new tag set, and
title if changed) and wait for an explicit "yes / haan / confirm" for *that
listing*. Only then make the single call. Move to the next listing and repeat.
If the user says "do them all," still walk through each one's confirmation — a
single ambiguous "yes" is not sign-off for a batch.

After all confirmed swaps are applied, offer to run **etsy-listing-qa-check**
against the updated listing(s) as an independent confirmation that the live
tags match the shop's field/style rules (length, lowercase, no duplicates).

## Fallback

If you're unsure of exact `update_listing` field names (e.g. how tags vs. title
are passed), look them up live via the **etsy-docs** MCP:
`get_endpoint("updateListing")` or `search_etsy_api`. Don't guess field shapes
against a live shop.
