description: Mechanically validates listing(s) against the shop's own hard-coded field rules in ../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md — title length & front-loading, exactly 13 tags each ≤20 chars with no duplicates/near-duplicates/uppercase, description hook length, materials/styles format, plus the Copy QA Gate (no em dashes, no AI-tell phrasing, no placeholders). This is a rules-compliance checker, not a competitive benchmark — it answers "does this listing follow OUR standards", not "how does it compare to competitors" (that's etsy-optimize-listing) or "is this good strategy" (that's etsy-audit-listing/etsy-audit-listings). Works on ONE listing (give an id/URL) or the WHOLE catalog (omit one — checks every active listing). Trigger this whenever the user asks to "QA check this listing", "does this follow our rules", "validate against our standards", "check my listing/listings for rule violations", "run a compliance check", "benchmark my tags/title against our rules", or wants a fast rules pass/fail rather than a strategic critique or competitive rewrite.

# Etsy Listing QA / Compliance Check

A fast, mechanical, rule-by-rule pass: does this listing (or every listing in the shop) technically comply with the exact field rules and style rules this shop has defined for itself? No competitor research, no strategy judgment — just pass/fail per rule, with the exact violation and the exact fix. **Read-only — never edits anything.**

Every tool accepts an optional `account` argument; pass it if the user names a specific shop, otherwise the default is used.

**`../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md` is the single source of truth for every rule checked here.** Read it at the start of every run. Do not hardcode a second copy of any rule in this file — if a rule changes there (e.g. a tag-length limit), this skill's checks change automatically. If a field name is unclear on any endpoint, confirm via the read-only `etsy-docs` MCP (`get_endpoint`, `search_etsy_api`) rather than guessing.

## How this differs from the other audit/optimize skills

- **etsy-audit-listing / etsy-audit-listings** — subjective quality and strategy critique (is the title compelling, are images well-ordered), scored on a point budget. Broader than rules compliance.
- **etsy-optimize-listing** — competitive benchmark against competitors and the shop's own best-sellers, produces a strategic rewrite.
- **This skill** — none of that. Purely mechanical: does the text technically obey the rules this shop has already written down for itself? No research step, no benchmarking, fast to run, same result every time given the same listing and the same standards file.

Point users to the other two when they want strategy or competitive positioning, not just rule compliance.

## Scope — single listing or whole catalog

- **User names a listing** (id or URL): check that ONE listing only. Call `get_listing_details`.
- **No listing named**: check every active listing in the shop. Call `find_all_active_listings_by_shop` to get all ids, then batch-fetch with `get_listings_by_ids` — do not loop one call per listing (5 req/s, 5,000/day limit).

## Rule checks — every check cites the exact rule it enforces

### Title
- Length ≤140 characters.
- Primary keyword appears within the first ~40 characters (front-loaded).
- Characters `% : & +` each appear at most once.
- No word three times and no back-to-back rephrasing of the same phrase (the product noun may appear twice; see Repetition in the SEO standards).
- Title shorter than **130 characters** -> flag as unused keyword space (target 135-140, owner decision 2026-10-21); advisory, with the fix being another distinct evidenced keyword phrase, never padding.

### Tags
- Exactly 13 tags present — flag any unused slots.
- Each tag ≤20 characters.
- Only letters, numbers, whitespace, `-`, `'` (not as first character), ™, ©, ® — flag any other character.
- No tag exactly duplicates another tag on the listing or the title verbatim.
- No near-duplicate tags (same word/phrase rephrased instead of covering a new buyer intent).
- **No uppercase letters** — flag every tag containing one.
- **Buyer-intent distinctness, not just textual distinctness.** Map the 13 tags
  against the intent buckets `etsy-new-listing-copywriter` uses when allocating
  slots (what-it-is / material-format / occasion / recipient / use-case-placement
  / style-aesthetic / underexploited-gap angle). Flag if any single bucket holds
  more than 4 of the 13 tags, or if fewer than 4 buckets are covered at all —
  13 tags that are all textually unique can still cover only two or three real
  buyer intents, which is a search-reach problem this check exists to catch even
  though the near-duplicate check above wouldn't flag it.

### Market fit (advisory; needs the latest research for the listing's category, otherwise skip it and say so)
Uses the newest `data/research/<category-slug>/<date>/stats.json` (see `../_shared/rank-first-title-guide.md`) and `data/title-patterns.json`.
- **Head term:** the exact head term is one of the 13 tags. Flag if missing (market median 73%).
- **Evidence ratio:** at least 10 of 13 tags appear in the category stats (>=2 listings) or in the tags bank with `source: market`. Report "n/13 evidenced".
  More than 3 unevidenced tags is a flag.
- **Title lead:** for a *motif* term the exact phrase is in the first 40 characters.
- **Expired seasonal tags:** a `halloween` tag after Oct 31, `christmas` after Dec 26, `valentine` after Feb 15.
- **Price band:** a price below the like-for-like p25 or above p75 (advisory only, never a fail; the owner's "price below average" instruction is unchanged).
- **Material claim:** `925` / `sterling` / `solid gold` in title, tags or materials must match PRODUCT ANALYSIS / the spec sheet; flag for review if the product says plated or alloy.
- **Tag-to-photo truth:** a format word (stud, hoop, choker, cuff, huggie) must match the product type shown.

### Description
- Opening ~160 characters read as a standalone hook (ad-headline style), not a scene-setter.
- Overall length roughly 150-400 words — flag if wildly outside this band (soft check, not a hard fail).

### Materials / Styles
- `materials`: letters/numbers/whitespace only, no punctuation or hyphens.
- `styles`: at most 2 entries, each ≤45 characters, letters/numbers/whitespace only.

### Copy quality (from the Copy QA Gate)
- No em dashes.
- No AI-tell phrasing ("Whether you're X or Y", "Look no further", rhetorical-question openers, rule-of-three adjective stacks).
- No leftover placeholders or template artifacts ("[insert X]", stray brackets, double spaces).

These last three overlap with the Copy QA Gate that `etsy-new-listing-copywriter`/`etsy-optimize-listing`/`etsy-seasonal-keywords` already run at drafting time — this skill re-checks them against **live** listings, including ones written before the gate existed or edited manually outside this system, which is exactly the gap this skill covers that the drafting-time gate can't.

### Listing Completeness Gate (from `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`)
This is the same hard checklist `etsy-create-listing` is required to clear **before** a
draft is ever created — this skill re-checks it against listings that may have been
created before the gate existed, built by hand outside this system, or edited in a way
that dropped a required field. Call `get_listing` (already fetched above), plus
`get_listing_images`, `get_listing_inventory`, `get_all_listing_files` (digital/both
only), and `get_listing_personalization` — all read-only, no OAuth write scope needed.

- **`price` > 0** and **`quantity`** set.
- **`who_made`** and **`when_made`** both set (not null).
- **`taxonomy_id`** set (not null/0).
- **`type`** explicitly physical/download/both.
- **At least 1 image** (`get_listing_images` non-empty) — a listing with zero images
  fails this check regardless of how good its copy is.
- **Image count/order — warn, not fail.** Below 5 images, flag it as a conversion-risk
  warning (target is 8-10 per `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`'s Completeness Gate) —
  don't fail the listing over this the way a zero-image listing fails, but don't stay
  silent about it either.
- **Every image has non-empty `alt_text`.** Per the standing default (image alt text =
  the listing's own tags, comma-joined), flag any image with empty/null `alt_text` —
  fixable in place via `upload_listing_image` with that image's `listing_image_id`
  (no `image_path` needed, confirmed live — no re-upload required).
- **Physical/both only**: `shipping_profile_id` set; `readiness_state_id` set on the
  listing and on every `offerings` entry in `get_listing_inventory`. **Clothing/apparel
  listings additionally need a size-chart image** in the gallery (see the shared
  Completeness Gate) — flag if the images show no chart-like image and nothing in the
  local record notes one.
- **Digital/both only**: `get_all_listing_files` returns at least 1 file — a digital
  listing with no attached file cannot actually be bought. Also check the description
  states plainly that no physical item ships (the shared field rules require this line
  for digital listings — it preempts the most common 1-star review on digital
  products); flag if it's missing.
- **Personalizable products only** (title/description implies "custom"/"personalized"/
  "add your name" etc.): `get_listing_personalization` returns at least 1 question.
  When it does, also re-validate every question against the hard-won payload rules in
  `CLAUDE.md` (`question_text` 1-45 chars; `instructions` ≤120 chars and absent
  entirely on `dropdown` questions; `labeled_upload` has an `options` array with
  `max_allowed_files` matching the label count and ≥2; `unlabeled_upload`'s
  `max_allowed_files` is also ≥2, never 1; at most one upload-type question per
  listing) — this catches a manually-edited or pre-system listing that would 400
  opaquely on a future `update_listing_personalization` call, before that call is
  ever attempted.
- **Price-positioning check, only if a research price band was recorded.** If the
  listing's `data/listings/<account>/<listing_id>.json` record has a non-null
  `research` object (see `../_shared/listings-record-guide.md`), compare the live
  `price` against its `landed_price_band`. Warn (don't fail) if the live price sits
  well outside that band with nothing in the record explaining why — this is meant to
  catch silent price drift after creation, not to second-guess a deliberate
  since-changed price.

This is the one non-copy category this skill checks, because a missing required field
(no image, no shipping profile, no digital file) makes a listing literally unsellable —
a bigger problem than any tag/title rule violation, and worth surfacing in the same
mechanical pass rather than waiting for `etsy-audit-listing` to catch it later.

### Listings-record file (local bookkeeping — the one thing this skill DOES fix, not just flag)
Per `../_shared/listings-record-guide.md`, **every listing this system has ever drafted, published, or updated must have a current `data/listings/<account>/<listing_id>.json` record** — this is mandatory, not opt-in, and every field present in the live listing must be captured in it, nothing skipped. Check:
- File exists at `data/listings/<account>/<listing_id>.json`.
- Every field in the file's `listing_data` matches the live listing (`get_listing`) — title, tags, description, price, quantity, who_made, when_made, taxonomy_id, materials, styles, shipping_profile_id, readiness_state_id, return_policy_id, processing_min/max.
- `variants` matches live `get_listing_inventory` (or is `null` if the listing has none).
- `images` matches live `get_listing_images` (id/rank/alt_text per image).
- `state` matches the listing's live state.

Unlike every other check in this skill, **this one is not read-only** — a missing or stale record is local bookkeeping, not an Etsy write, so fix it directly: create the file if absent, or update whichever fields are stale, using Write/Edit (never an `etsy` MCP tool for this file). No user confirmation needed for this specific fix (same as the guide's own sync-on-every-update rule) — just mention briefly that the record was created/synced.

## What this skill does NOT check

No subjective quality judgment (is the title compelling, are images well-composed/ordered), no reviews, no competitor comparison, no `state` (active/inactive) sellability beyond the Completeness Gate items above — those are covered by `etsy-audit-listing`/`etsy-audit-listings` and `etsy-optimize-listing`. Keep this skill narrow and mechanical; if the user wants a fuller picture, point them there after this report.

```

## Report structure — whole catalog (no listing named)

```
# QA Compliance Check — <Shop Name>
_<N> active listings scanned_

## Compliance table
| Listing (title — id) | Title | Tags | Description | Materials/Styles | Copy quality | Completeness Gate | Violations |
|-----------------------|-------|------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------|
| ...                   | ✓/✗   | ✓/✗  | ✓/✗          | ✓/✗               | ✓/✗          | ✓/✗                | <count>    |
(sorted by violation count, worst first; fully-clean listings can be summarized as a count rather than listed individually. A Completeness Gate failure — missing image, missing shipping profile, missing digital file — is always listed first among violations for that row, since it makes the listing unsellable, not just SEO-weak)

## Shop-wide violation summary
- <e.g. "14 of 87 listings have at least one uppercase tag">
- <e.g. "6 listings are under 13/13 tags">
- <e.g. "3 listings have a title over 140 chars">

## Top offenders — exact fixes
1. <listing id> → <exact violation and fix>
2. ...
```

## Next step

This skill only diagnoses rule violations — it never calls `update_listing`. Point the user to:
- **etsy-optimize-listing** — to actually fix a flagged listing's title/tags/description with a confirm-before-write diff.
- **etsy-audit-listing** / **etsy-audit-listings** — if they also want the broader strategy/quality critique, not just rules compliance.
