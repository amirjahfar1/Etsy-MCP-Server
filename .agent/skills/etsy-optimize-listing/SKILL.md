description: The flagship "make it sell like a top seller" skill — rewrites and improves ONE listing by benchmarking it against BOTH the shop's own best-selling listings AND top-ranking competitor listings in the same keyword space, then presents a concrete OLD→NEW rewrite (title, full 13 tags, description, price) as a diff and waits for confirmation before writing. Trigger this whenever the user asks to "optimize this listing", "make this listing sell better", "rewrite my listing to compete with top sellers", "why is a competitor outselling me on this", "improve my listing so it ranks", or wants a specific listing actually rewritten/leveled-up (not just diagnosed). When the user wants the fix drafted and applied, this is the skill.

# Etsy Listing Optimizer — Benchmark & Rewrite

This is the skill that turns a diagnosis into a competitive rewrite. It doesn't just critique — it studies what's actually winning (both inside the shop and among top competitors for the same keywords) and rewrites the target listing's title, tags, description, and price to match those winning patterns. It produces a concrete OLD → NEW diff and then **stops and waits for the user's explicit confirmation before writing anything to Etsy.**

Every tool accepts an optional `account` argument; pass it if the user names a specific shop, otherwise the default is used.

Read `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md` if unsure of a field limit (tag length, title length) or a blind spot — it's shared across all five audit/optimize/QA skills (including etsy-listing-qa-check) so the rules stay consistent.

## Safety — confirm before any write (non-negotiable)

This project manages a **real, live-money shop**, and `update_listing` changes are live and mostly irreversible. Therefore:

- The skill's job ends at **presenting the OLD → NEW diff**. Do **not** call `update_listing` (or any `create_*`/`update_*`/`delete_*` tool) as part of producing the recommendation.
- Only after the user gives an explicit "yes / haan / confirm" against the shown diff may `update_listing` be called — and the call must apply exactly what was shown (which listing, which fields, old → new values), nothing more.
- If the user tweaks the draft, re-run the Copy QA Gate against the tweaked text, then re-show the updated diff and get confirmation again. Never treat an ambiguous "sounds good" about the analysis as approval to write.
- A **partial confirmation** ("yes, but keep the price the same" / "apply the tags but not the title") is not a blanket yes — regenerate the diff with only the approved fields changed, show that narrower diff, and get confirmation again before writing.
- **Re-fetch immediately before writing.** Time may have passed between showing the diff and the user's confirmation (they may have edited the listing elsewhere, or it may have auto-renewed). Call `get_listing_details` again right before the `update_listing` call. If any "OLD" value no longer matches what was shown in the confirmed diff, **stop, do not write** — re-present the diff against the current data instead. Writing against stale OLD values risks silently reverting a change the user made elsewhere.
- **After writing, re-fetch and echo back the applied values** so the user sees the write actually landed as intended, not just that the call returned success. **Then sync the changed fields into that listing's record** per `../_shared/listings-record-guide.md` (`data/listings/<account>/<listing_id>.json`) — mandatory, no separate confirmation, just keep it current alongside the confirmed Etsy write. Then offer to run **etsy-listing-qa-check** against the updated listing as an independent confirmation that the live listing matches the rules the rewrite was drafted against.

All the research steps below use read-only tools (`get_*`, `search_*`) and need no confirmation — only the final `update_listing` does.

## Why benchmark against two references

Optimizing in a vacuum produces generic listings. The winning move is to triangulate:
- **The shop's own best-sellers** show what already converts *for this brand and audience* — proven title cadence, tag style, price band. Copy what already works internally.
- **Top-ranking competitors** for the target keyword show what Etsy's search is currently rewarding in this niche — the keyword combinations and positioning buyers are clicking right now.

Diffing the target against both, rather than against best-practice theory alone, is what makes the rewrite competitive instead of merely tidy.

## Mandatory gates (single checklist — do not restate rules here)

Run every gate in `../_shared/listing-gates.md` that applies to this flow, in order A → B → C → D → E: shop-DNA read,
`sources` hard-block, trademark screen, photo verification, jewelry style-match, **rank-first title**
(`../_shared/rank-first-title-guide.md`), Copy QA Gate, **DELIVERY TIME FRAME** block, table-confirmed write,
listings-record / tags-bank / registry bookkeeping, final verification. The steps below add flow-specific detail only;
they never override a gate. If this file ever disagrees with that checklist or CLAUDE.md, the checklist wins — report the
contradiction to the user instead of choosing silently.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the core keyword(s).** Call `get_listing_details` on the target listing. Extract its primary keyword(s) from the current title and tags — the phrases a buyer would actually type. Treat this as a starting suggestion to confirm in step 2, not a final answer.

2. **Check the tags database, then ask the user how to source the external benchmark, before searching anything.** First check `../_shared/tags-database-guide.md`'s database for a category matching this listing's product/niche. Ask directly, adding a third option if a matching category has saved tags: "Do you want to give me specific best-selling / competitor listings to benchmark against, should I search for them myself, or should I use the saved tags already in the database for `<category>`?"
   - **User provides listings:** wait for their listing URLs/IDs (or shop names). Call `get_listing_details` on exactly those as the external benchmark set — skip the keyword search below.
   - **Skill searches:** ask the user for **3-5 target keywords** to research (offer the keyword extracted in step 1 as a starting suggestion, but let them confirm or replace it). For each keyword, call `search_listings` and fetch **10-15 results per keyword**, not 2-3, then `get_listing_details` on that set.
   - **Use saved tags:** treat the database's saved tags for that category as this run's tag findings (skip the live search), but still re-validate each against the current field/style rules before drafting — a title/description still needs fresh research, so this option only substitutes for the tag half of the benchmark.

3. **Deeply analyze the benchmark set like a competitive-research agency would, not a quick skim.** For each listing, read:
   - **Title construction** — is the primary keyword front-loaded? Length used, separators/punctuation style, benefit words, what repeats across listings.
   - **Description construction** — how it opens, structure (bullets vs prose), what info leads (size/use/material/personalization), tone.
   - **Tags** — the exact tags each listing uses.
   Treat a pattern as real only if **at least half the sample shares it** — 2 listings doing the same thing is coincidence, not a signal. State plainly that ranking is also driven by factors this rewrite cannot copy (listing age, historical conversion rate, review volume) — matching a top listing's structure doesn't guarantee matching its rank.

4. **Run a tag frequency analysis and report it as counts, not a vibe.** Tally every tag across the full benchmark set. Report explicitly which tags are **common** (used by a majority of the benchmark — high-signal, worth including) versus **unique/long-tail** (used by only one or two listings — lower competition, worth testing) — e.g. "7 of the 13 recommended tags appear in 60%+ of the benchmark; 4 are unique long-tail finds used by only one listing." This tag list is what step 8 builds the title and description around — **tags come first, then copy is written to work the winning tags in naturally**, not the other way around. Right after presenting this analysis (skip if this run used saved database tags from step 2 rather than fresh research), automatically save these tags to the tags database — no need to ask — see `../_shared/tags-database-guide.md` for the save workflow.

5. **Pull the internal benchmark — the shop's own winners, defined precisely.** Pull `get_receipt_transactions_by_shop` over a **trailing 90-day window** (or the last ~100 transactions if the shop is slow, whichever gives more signal), count sales per `listing_id`, and only treat a listing as a "winner" if it has **at least 5 sales** in that window. Prefer winners that are the **same product type / section** as the target — a top-selling listing from a completely different product line has the wrong title cadence to imitate. **If fewer than 3 listings qualify as winners, skip the internal benchmark and say so explicitly in the report** rather than forcing a comparison against a thin or mismatched sample. Batch listing detail lookups with `get_listings_by_ids` — respect the 5 req/s, 5,000/day limit.

6. **Extract the shop's own voice.** Before drafting anything, read the description style of the shop's qualifying winners (and the shop's `get_shop` announcement/bio) — recurring phrases, tone, formatting conventions (bullet lists vs prose, emoji use, how sizing/shipping info is presented). The rewrite should sound like this shop, not like a generic AI-optimized listing — otherwise every "optimized" listing in the shop converges on the same voice and the brand gets diluted.

7. **Diff the target against both benchmarks**, leading with tags since the title and description are derived from them:
   - **Tag usage** — all **13 slots** filled with distinct long-tail phrases from the step 4 frequency analysis that the target is missing? Every proposed tag must be **≤20 characters**, **all lowercase**, and not an exact duplicate of another tag or the title (see `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md`) — a rewrite the API rejects (or that fails the shop's own lowercase style rule) after the user already confirmed it is a wasted round-trip.
   - **Title structure** — is the primary keyword front-loaded like the winners? Length used? Does it work in the highest-value tags from step 4?
   - **Description structure** — does it open strong and cover what/size/format/use the way winners do, in the shop's own voice from step 6, while naturally working in the winning tags?
   - **Price positioning** — compare **landed price** (listing price + primary domestic shipping rate from the shop's shipping profile), not bare price, against the shop's winners and the competitor band. Under- or over-priced for the signal? Note that competitor prices may reflect an active sale the API can't distinguish from list price — flag as a caveat, don't assert certainty.
   - **Seasonality** — if the target listing currently carries deliberately-inserted seasonal keywords mid-window (see `etsy-seasonal-keywords`), don't recommend stripping them just because they look unusual; fold them into the rewrite instead of discarding them.

8. **Produce the rewrite** — start from the step 4 tag list, then build a concrete new title and description draft (in the shop's voice) that naturally work those tags in, plus a landed-price recommendation, each justified by what the benchmarks showed. If the internal benchmark was skipped (step 5), say the rewrite leans more heavily on the external benchmark and flag that as a lower-confidence recommendation.

9. **Run the Copy QA Gate before presenting the diff.** The full checklist lives in
   `../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md` — no em dashes, grade 5-7 reading level, no
   AI-tell phrasing, no misleading claims, not
   copied verbatim from the competitor benchmark read in step 2-3, no leftover
   placeholders, tone matches the shop's voice. **This is a hard gate: the NEW
   title/tags/description must pass it before the diff is shown to the user, and
   again immediately before `update_listing` is called** (a user's field-specific
   edit after seeing the diff needs its own QA pass too). Note "QA: passed" in the
   report per the shared file's instruction.

If a field name is unclear on any endpoint, confirm via the read-only `etsy-docs` MCP (`get_endpoint`, `search_etsy_api`) before building the `update_listing` payload.

## Blind spot to state

This optimizes for the signals it can actually observe — title, tags, price, and sales — because the Etsy API exposes **no traffic/click-through/conversion data** (no views, no favorites trend, no funnel) and **no Ads data**. So the rewrite is a well-grounded hypothesis, not a guarantee. Tell the user to watch **actual sales over the following weeks** as the real ground truth (favorites/views can only be checked manually in Etsy's own seller dashboard — this system has no API access to that data), and to revert or re-optimize if the numbers don't move. If photos are part of the problem, `upload_listing_image`/`upload_listing_video` can actually upload a replacement once the owner has one ready and confirms — but this skill still can't judge photo quality itself, so recommending a reshoot is still a human call.

## Report structure

Always output in exactly this format:

```
# Listing Optimization — "<title>" (id <listing_id>)

## Core keyword(s)
<the phrases this rewrite targets>

## Benchmarks
**External (top competitors for "<keyword(s)>"):** <patterns observed — title/description/tag construction>
**Internal (this shop's own best-sellers):** <patterns observed>

## Tag frequency analysis
<count of common tags (majority of benchmark) vs unique/long-tail tags (1-2 listings only), from the full benchmark set>

## Diff
### Tags (13)
OLD: <current tags, note X/13 used>
NEW: <full 13-tag list>
_Why: ..._ (tie back to the frequency analysis above)

### Title
OLD: <current>
NEW: <proposed — built around the NEW tags above>
_Why: <benchmark-backed reason>_

### Description
OLD (summary): <what it does now>
NEW:
<full proposed description draft, in the shop's own voice, working in the NEW tags naturally>
_Why: ..._

### Price (landed = price + primary domestic shipping)
OLD: <current landed price>
NEW: <proposed landed price> — _Why: positioning vs winners/competitors_

## Confidence
<state whether the internal benchmark had enough qualifying winners (≥3 with
≥5 sales each in the last 90 days); if not, say the rewrite leans on the
external benchmark alone and is lower-confidence>

## QA
Passed — see ../_shared/etsy-seo-standards.md Copy QA Gate (no em dashes,
grade 5-7 reading level, no AI-tell phrasing, not
copied from the competitor benchmark).

## Watch after applying
- Track actual sales over the next few weeks — that's the real signal this
  system can see. Favorites/views can only be checked manually in Etsy's own
  seller dashboard; the API gives no view/CTR/favorites/conversion data to
  confirm this in advance.

## Confirmation required
This is a draft only. Reply "yes / confirm" to apply these exact changes to the
listing via update_listing, or name specific fields to accept/reject for a
narrower confirmation. Nothing is written until you confirm.
```

Do not call `update_listing` until the user confirms against this diff. Immediately before calling it, re-fetch the listing — if anything shown as OLD has changed since the diff was presented, stop and re-present instead of writing. After the call succeeds, re-fetch once more and report back the actual applied values.
